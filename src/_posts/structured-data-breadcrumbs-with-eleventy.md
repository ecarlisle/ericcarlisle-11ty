<p>I made this top-load trading card box to store <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magic: The Gathering</a> cards I collected from centuries past. It will store around 800 cards and will fit cards having light sleeves. The lift-off lid has a 0.6mm width and length clearance gap from the main container, providing a comfortable fit. All walls are 1.2mm, giving it adequate strength with minimal material usage.</p>
